FOSS Stream Tools (Screens) - modular web screens

## OwO What's This?
I started streaming. I needed some screens (Starting Soon, BRB Toast, Technical Difficulties, etcetera). OBS can capture a web source with GPU acceleration, and show it full screen. Made this repository, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and made it FOSS for any streamers who want their own, fully customiseable screens for their streams, free.

Side note, [donations](https://sleepingami.dpdns.org/donate) are greatly appreciated, and completely optional. If you use this repo or appreciate the detail, donations help.
